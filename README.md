# Learn DevOps

Below you find explanations of the basic theory and tools needed to get started with DevOps. Further, we will explore some of its practices. Once you know all about DevOps and its practices, we want to highlight the gap between knowing all about DevOps and successfully adapting DevOps. :bulb:

We will explore the theory and tools based on the DevOps Roadmap created and maintained by [kamranahmedse](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). Make sure to not only leave a star on this GitHub Repository, but [kamranahmedse's](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) as well. Or take a look at the DevOps and other Roadmaps [here](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps).

## Note

Fully understanding DevOps and the knowledge it requires will not happen overnight. Make sure you put the theory, tools and practices outlined below into practice. For example, in an existing project or even build small projects around the topics discussed to get the best learning experience.

If you should already be familiar with DevOps, share this resource with others. Use it to refresh your knowledge and feel free to contribute if you think certain things could be updated / further improved.

Thank you for stopping by, now let's get started :zap:

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a method used in day to day processes to increase efficiency and improve delivery time.<sup>[1](#the-complete-guide-to-devops)</sup> Instead of having the development and operations teams work separately, the teams work together from concept to execution to delivery and support. 

This includes involving the operations team when code is planned, written, tested and shipped as well as involving the development team in the relevant operations processes.



DevOps attempts to ensure continuous delivery with high-quality software by combining software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).

## Why do we need DevOps?

In a nutshell, DevOps can prevent a lot of heartache, frustration and inefficiency.<sup>[1](#the-complete-guide-to-devops)</sup> Especially between development and operations teams, which would otherwise work strictly separately from each other, and possibly other departments involved in development.
